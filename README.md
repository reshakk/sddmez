# sddmez

All files I take from [JaKooLit simple-sddm](https://github.com/JaKooLit/simple-sddm-2). I just changed the configuration and design for my system and auto-script for arch.

Main settings in: `/etc/sddm.conf.d/sddmez.conf`
Directory with sddm-themes: `/usr/share/sddm/themes`
Default configuration: `/usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/default.conf`
